                <p>The residents of these houses in Patulul will be educated at the Green Building Academy, a building school in Comalapa, Guatemala. Green Building Academy offers a four-week education program, teaching building in the fields of Earth, water, construction, and power. Construction is the only skill that will need to be taught for repairs, so the residents will only be signed up for the construction week of education in July of 2023. Green Building Academy is provided by an educational institution called Long Way Home. Experts in their field teach the students of Green Building Academy construction skills. The residents will be sent to Green Building Academy during the first of the two weeks their house is being built. They will not have to worry about meeting their basic needs, as the academy will provide purified drinking water, three meals a day, kitchen and house essentials, and beds. When the residents return in the second week, their newly-gained construction skills can help them finish building the house, so they will help the construction crew finish building it in addition to knowing how to repair the house.</p>
