                <p>The construction week of education will cost $600, as only one adult will be educated and the price per person is $600. In addition, there is a 50% reduction for Latin Americans, putting the price at $300. However, a significant factor increasing the cost will be transportation. Transportation between Comalapa and Patulul costs $72.50 via taxi. To take the adult there and back, the total transportation cost will be $145. The total cost to educate the adult, which DCS will pay for, is $445. Ben Saacks, the CEO, will contribute $155 to the cost, while Adam DeBasc, the COO, and Ben Chesnoff, the CFO, will contribute $135 each.</p>
